            Hi! Welcome to the Fremont Dog Plaza, we are happy you found your way here. Our mission is simple,
            facilitate a safe environment for you and your dog. Every day we will strive to do our best
            to keep the small and large play groups separate and safe. We offer boarding, daycare,
            and grooming services. Our services and business model is not centered around staying at the
            facility, we take dogs on group walks too. Walking every dog in our facility, every day.
            The walks could last 45 minutes or 3 hours, all depending on how nice the weather is and how
            active the dogs are. After the dogs have been active, we offer a naptime every day
            from 3pm to 6pm for the health of your dog. This helps ensure they are not overworked and
            stressed due to high levels of intense play. During intense playtime your dog may become stinky.
            When a stinky dog plays at the Fremont Dog Plaza enough days every month, we will offer your dog a free grooming.
            It is your choice to accept or deny the grooming, however any dogs with excessive smell or poor hygiene will be turned away from care.
            Poor hygiene causes a risk of set-in germs and bacteria spreading to other dogs. For the safety of the dogs in our care we attempt to uphold
            the highest level of sanitation possible by making sure grooming is available, for free, to all of our returning
            and respected customers. With enough effort and dedication from our team we hope to make the Fremont Dog Plaza your pups home away from home.<br>
            <br>
            The Fremont Dog Plaza was originally started in 2016 under the name Dog Dude Taylors. Taylor, who only wanted to spend more time with his dog at first,
            began walking and boarding dogs in the CapHill neighborhood of Seattle. Scout and Taylor walked together for almost two decades, and after years of walking and meeting new clients,
            something Scout loved to do, she passed away August of 2021 at the age of 18. However, that did not mean the end of a great experience. A great experience created for Scout to enjoy
            life with all her friends. Taylor plans to continue to work with dogs to this day and beyond. Expanding into the Fremont Dog Plaza and bringing great employees along the way.
            During this journey and every step down the road, we hope that we can be a positive part of your dog’s history. Their memories and to have them be safe is what matters most to us!<br>
            <br>
            Along our journey we always look to improve and find new forms of innovation that can better impact the life of your dog. If there are any suggestions or concerns,
            please feel free to share them with us at any time. Also, if there are services you would like us to offer, please inform us. Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you soon!
